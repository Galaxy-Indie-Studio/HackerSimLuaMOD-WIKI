# How To Get Started

The first thing that you want to do is unzip your game. Now that may come to a suprise to you but it's actual quite simple! Hacker Sim was made using the 2D Framework which allows you to simple rename a .zip file to a .love file which runs the game! So rename the .love to .zip

then use a file unzipper like winrar or something similar to it!
